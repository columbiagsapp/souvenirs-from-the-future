#Souvenirs from the Future

Interactive installation for Alumni Leaders Weekend, presented by Arts Access and GSAPP. Strategy and execution by the Architecture Online Lab.

For the annual Columbia Alumni Leaders Weekend, we installed a green screen step-and-repeat for alumni to take their photos in front of, from which our team then did live Photoshopping to crop subjects out and insert them into renderings of architecture of the future done by GSAPP students and recent grads.

The images were then printed out and given as "souvenirs from the future".

They were also posted online on the [Columbia Alumni Association facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153346664500198.1073741858.195421575197&type=1) by Columbia Arts Access.

We also produced a series of printed assets to illustrate how it would work and promote the installation.
