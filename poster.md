# Souvenirs from the Future

The 21st century is here, but the 21st century city has yet to be built. The 21st century city lives in the dreams of the Columbia students of today, they will design and build the cities of tomorrow that will represent the century we aspire to inhabit today.

Alumni Arts Access in collaboration with the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) invite you to picture yourself in one of six urban futures imagined by GSAPP students. Visit our green screen step-and-repeat at the west end of the room, have your picture taken, and GSAPP students will place you into the future city of your choice.

Don't be shy! The most daring will find their way onto the Columbia Alumni Association Facebook page.
