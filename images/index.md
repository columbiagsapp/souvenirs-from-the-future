As the city grows, land values increase, often resulting in urban sprawl. Rethinking the street as potential buildable space allows the traditional urban fabric to be redirected. Just as Rem Koolhaas argued that the invention of the elevator allowed urban space to exist on a new vertical axis, so too can a reconception of the street allow for mobility in multiple axes.

### Caption

Beneath Manhattan lies an existing subterranean urban ecology of waterways and potential spaces for plant life to grow and thrive. gang(GREEN) is an underground park that feeds into this network, spreading green throughout the city from below, erupting at moments to contaminate the grid and infect the island and its infrastructure, thus regaining the balance between nature and architecture.

### Caption

Descent into a secret landscape of both active and forgotten infrastructure exposes visitors to the organs of a living, breathing city. Motion is abstracted and revealed at key moments punctuated by intrusions of light, sound, and touch.

### Caption

Water SpArrows is a radical proposal for bombing the Hudson with leisure platforms. Once the fallen arrow has gathered enough energy, air is purged from the arrowhead and the inversion turns the bomb into an island!
